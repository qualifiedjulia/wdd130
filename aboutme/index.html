        <h2>Julia Garcia</h1>
        <p>My name is Julia, and I am an illustration major. I love making many different kinds of art, but my favorite 
            medium is digital art. I hope to use my degree to make comic books one day. I've been wanting to learn how to make my own 
            website for a while, so I am very excited to learn a lot in this class.</p>
        <p>In my free time I'm usually drawing or crocheting. I've been learning how to crochet for the last few years, and I have been really enjoying it.</p>
